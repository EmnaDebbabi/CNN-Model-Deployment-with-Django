# CNN-Model-Deployment-with-Django
##Tools
We require specialized tools for each type of project before we can build it. In our case to deploy
the CNN model, the first part of the project, We have used python 3.7 as
programming language also tensorflow 2.2 and anaconda as a framework that manages the packages.
Finally, for the deployment part we chose Django as a framework with sqlite3 as a database.
